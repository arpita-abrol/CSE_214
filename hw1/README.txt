	   Testing is done in the main method: 
	   "int arr[]" is the array of int values
	   "int sum" is the given sum
	   "hasPair(arr, sum)" is the function that checks if arr[] contains two values that equal the sum

	b. CODE: run hw1.java
	   javac hw1.java; java hw1
	   Testing is done in the main method: 
	   "int arr3[]" is the array of int values
	   "int sum3" is the given sum

Problem 2.
	Code can be found in CreditCard.java
	javac CreditCard.java; java CreditCard
	A testing case can be found in the main method
	First, create an object, newCard, of type CreditCard
	chargeIt(price) can be tested by calling newCard.chargeIt(price);
